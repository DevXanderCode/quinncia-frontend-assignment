# Quinncia 2020 Front-End Developer Position Assignment

Brief description:
> We would like to see the ability to create application that is broken down into components and use API efficiently. Based on the prototype provided (assets/prototype), your task is to create a simple app that would get photos from the back end, post new pictures, comments and tags

**Required technology**:
- ReactJS
- Redux


**Expected behaviour**:
- Post and display photos
- Comment under any photo (including subcomments)
- Add tags and attach them to photos while posting
- Search for photos using tags

You are free to use any library for the assignment. We appreciate your time and we do not expect you to spend more than 3-4 hours for this project. If you believe that there was enough work done but you have not finished the project, you can send it to us at any stage. If there are any other projects that you would like to share and are open sourced, you can send a link to those instead of working on the assignment, although we would give this one more priority

**For any concerns**:
- konstantin@quinncia.io
- ramiz@quinncia.io
